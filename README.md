RJs
Js-like scripting for Rust projects.

Rust JavaScript or RJs aims to provide a JavaScript-like experience in the context of a rust project. So someone who is familiar with JavaScript could effectively write a program in Rust but using syntax and patterns familiar to them.

You can mix and match Js-like syntax in with regular rust code for gradual emersion and learning of rust. Or if the Js syntax is fitting, you may choose to use it for web projects, making portions of your program more accessible ie plugins/extensions, and so on.

For now you can see the example for what can be done until documentation is done.
